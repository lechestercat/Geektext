    []and may select whether they show their nickname(defined in their profile) or []remain anonymous. 
    []For Commenting: A single comment should be limited to the number of
    []characters, 
    []which can fit within half the browser window (so that there
    []are at least two comments which can appear at the same time). 
    []Users can only comment on a book if they’ve purchased it, 
    []and may select whether they show their nickname (defined in their profile) or
